This is a personal project with the intention of learning about graphics programming, game engine and UI design and how to deal with bigger projects.

To get started, clone this repository recursively and run `scripts/Setup.bat`. It will install the necessary dependencies and build the project for Visual Studio 2022.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/erikrl2/Eos
```
