This is a personal project with the intention of learning about graphics programming.

To get started, clone this repository recursively and run scripts/Setup.bat. It will install the necessary dependencies and build the project for Visual Studio 2022.
(Python is required to run the Setup script)

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/erikrl2/Eos
```
