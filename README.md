# Eos

A 2D game engine with OpenGL.

This is a personal project with the intention of learning about graphics programming.

Originally inspired by [Hazel2D](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) and the [Game Engine Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) on YouTube.

To get started, clone this repository recursively and run the Setup.bat script found in the scripts directory. This will install the necessary dependencies and build the project for Visual Studio 2022.
(Python is required to run the Setup script)

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/erikrl2/Eos`
